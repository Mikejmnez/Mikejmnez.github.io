A good starting point for the study of physical oceanography is a good background in analytical and numerical skills, as well as a solid foundation in **geophysical fluid dynamics**.

At the University of Washington, I had the priviledge of being a Teaching Assistant in **fluid dynamics** courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and I regularly organized and deviced laboratory experiments (demos) within the**GFD lab** to enhance a better understanding of complex processes. In addition to that, most of the time spent helping students was guiding them through the mathematical aspects encounter when studying such subjects.
