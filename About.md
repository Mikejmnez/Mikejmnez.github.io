I am a physical oceanographer interested in the role of mesoscale (O(10-100km)) and submesoscale (O(1-10km)) process on the large ocean circulation, which I investigate combining the use of idealized numerical simulations, analytical models and high resolution global circulation models.
Currently I am a Postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University in Prof. Thomas Haines Lab. I completed my PhD in **physical oceanography** at the University of Washington where I worked on idealized simulations of rotating, stratified flows across finite amplitude topography under the supervision of Prof. Luanne Thompson. 

I feel passionate about the study of physical oceanography through **Geophysical Fluid Dynamics** as the basis for understanding fundamental processes in physical oceanography, both from research perspective as well as to gain insight into the distinct processes that play a role in the ocean circulation.

>The desperation and frustratin of trying to solve a hard problem, one of those that hunt us in our dreams or keep us awake at night, those problems often nonlinear, with no (analytical) solution, should be our everyday necessity. Is there any other field, but the sciences that can provide us with such a feeling of being completely lost, when facing a new problem? <cite>A. Minzoni</cite>
