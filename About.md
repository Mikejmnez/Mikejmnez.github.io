I am a physical oceanographer interested in the large ocean circulation, currently a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Thomas Haines Lab at Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of Washington where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Luanne Thompson on idealized simulations of rotating, stratified flows across finite amplitude topography.
