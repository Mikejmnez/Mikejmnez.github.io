# Research Interest

With the advancement of computer power, we are approaching a regime shift in oceanography where GCMs will be able to reproduce scatter observations. In other ways, sampling of ocean models will be indistinguishable from samples from the real ocean, and thus the 

$
\begin{itemize}
\item Good theoretical understanding of the mesoscale and submesoscale processes.
\item Development of numerical and computer skills required to manipulate (\textit{e.g.} ) large volumes of data.
\item Deliver open-source plataforms that allow not only scientists but science-enthusiast to sample ocean models and compare with real ocean observations.
\end{itemize}
